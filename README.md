# Crypto-Statistical-Arbitrage
An exploration of statistical arbitrage in cryptocurrency markets

This repo explores statistical arbitrage strategies (stat arb) in cryptocurrency markets. Instead of arbitraging spatially (between physical or market locations), statistical arbitrage seeks to take advantage of apparent market inefficiencies based on short-term deviations from long-term historical statistical properties.

A common stat arb startegy is that of pairs trading, explored in this repo. The market thesis for the pairs trading note is as follows: Bitcoin is the genesis cryptocurrency and a tradable pairs trading strategy may exist between BTC and all other cryptocurrencies regardless of the statistical significance of their cointegration.
